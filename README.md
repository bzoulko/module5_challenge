# Module 05 Challenge Project - Work Day Scheduler
This program is an event scheduler for the current days business hours, 8AM to 5PM. The user can enter events throughout the day and save each event after it's keyed. Upon revisting the scheduler, the user can see what events have occured or are yet to come.


## Key elements in the game.
* Upon entering the website, you can see color coding that maps to:
  - grey for past events
  - pink for present events
  - green for future events

* The area to the right of a time slot is for keying events. Click on the field and you can start
  entering your event text.

* Saving events is as simple as clicking the button to the far right of the area you keyed your event into.
  Once saved, for that day only, you can revist and see all past, present, or future events.


### Spoecial Notes:
* Modifications to the HTML were made in the class area for the timeblock section. This helped
  to better align the time line items acrossed the page. All other features are done in the javascript using jQuery.

* Included "reset.css" to this project.
