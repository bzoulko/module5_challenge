# Module 05 Challenge Project - Work Day Scheduler
This program is an event scheduler for the current days business hours, 8AM to 5PM. The user can enter events throughout the day and save each event after it's keyed. Upon revisting the scheduler, the user can see what events have occured or are yet to come.


## Key elements in the game.
* Uppon entering the website, you can see color coding that maps to:
  - grey for past events
  - pink for present events
  - green for future evebnts

* The area to the right of a time slot is for keying events. Click on thes fields and you can start
  entering your event.

* Saving events is as simple as clicking the button to the far right of the are you keyed your event.
  Once saved, for that day, you can revist and see all past, present, or future events.
